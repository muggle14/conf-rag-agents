  "content": "Effective system monitoring is crucial for maintaining high availability and performance. Key metrics to track include CPU usage, memory utilization, disk I/O, network latency, and application response times. Set up alerts for critical thresholds: CPU > 80%, Memory > 90%, Disk > 85%. Use dashboards to visualize trends and identify patterns. Implement log aggregation for centralized troubleshooting. Regular review of monitoring data helps prevent issues before they impact users.",
